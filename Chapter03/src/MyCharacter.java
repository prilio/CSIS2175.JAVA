/*Computer games often contain different characters or creatures. For example,
you might design a game in which alien beings possess specific characteristics
such as color, number of eyes, or number of lives. Design a character for a game,
creating a class to hold at least three attributes for the character. Include methods
to get and set each of the characterâ€™s attributes. */
